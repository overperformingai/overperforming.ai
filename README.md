# OverperformingAI
A cheat-sheet style website to highlight common problems practitioners face when performing predictive modeling.

## Contributing
A technical guide to contributing to this project can be found in the [development](DEVELOPMENT.md) section. There is a lot todo, here is a very basic roadmap:

**Content:**
 - Add images to the mermaid SVGs
 - Unify the colour scheme across all plots
 - Add visualization for point in time correctness

**House-keeping:**
 - Make an improved logo
 - Minify everything for faster page loads
 - Ensure the page is responsive to different screen sizes
 - Easily include bibtex references
 - Render Mermaid diagrams to SVG and remove JS from the page
 - Setup deep links / permalinks to each `OPAI-x.x` section
    - Introduce versioning so permalinks to OPAI headers never break
